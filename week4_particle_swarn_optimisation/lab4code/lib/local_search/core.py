# Runs local search until a termination condition is reached then return the
# best solution found along with its cost.
# - initializer: a function which constructs a valid initial solution to the
#                problem being solved.
# - evaluate: A function to measure solution quality. Takes a valid solution as
#             input and returns its objective function value.
# - termination: A termination condition. Must be an object with a 
#                "condition_met" method which takes iteration count, the current
#                solution and its cost as input. Returns True if the
#                termination condition has been met, false otherwise.
# - neighbourhood: A neighbourhood function. Takes a solution as input and 
#                  returns a list containing all neighbours of that solution.
# - step: A step function. Takes the current solution and its cost, a list of
#         neighbours and an evaluation function. It chooses the next solution to
#         try in local search and returns it, along with its cost.
# - print_improvements: Whether to print the cost and value of improved
#                       solutions when they are found.
